# Everglades (South Florida) Herpetofaunal Publications
This repository is meant to contain spreadsheets / PDFs / and documents relating to publications about the herpetofauna of the Everglades. 

I published a review of the Everglades Herpetofauna research in 2023 as an update to Meshaka et al. (2000) paper. However, in order to provide a service to the community I have decided to continue to compile research that has come out. Since my paper contained a review over a 20 year period (2001 to 2021) those papers have already been included in all summary statistics and analysis within the paper. We did not include simple natural history notes, range extensions, or literature reviews due primarily to poor indexing for searches with the first two and a lack of primary research with the final one. The supplemental information file for that paper (contained in this repository) has been continuously updated to reflect new publications coming out.

If you find research that I have missed, please reach out to me so that I can add it to the database. 

I hope that you find this resource helpful for your research!
